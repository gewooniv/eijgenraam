# Eijgenraam.net

This is a project to share insights of our family history and genealogy with others. The current website is outdated and to be replaced by this one.

The current requirements are:
* an admin panel to add posts/articles
* a link and clear description to our family tree (external site)
* a comment section below posts
* a guestbook
